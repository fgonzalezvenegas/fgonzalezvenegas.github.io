Hi!  I'm a researcher on energy transition, with a special interests in Smart Grids, electro-mobility and renewable energy resources.
I like to address issues both on the technical (optimization, modelling) and the economic and regulatory (electricity markets, policy implications) sides.

I am currently working at Artelys as an energy and optimization engineer, adressing complex issues of the energy transition using advanced modelling tools, as well as diving into electricity market desing for flexibility.

I also contribute as a reviewer for journals and conferences in energy & power systems (SEGAN, EPSR, PSCC, RSER). 

From 2018 to 2021 I worked on my PhD at Universit√© Paris-Saclay in collaboration with Stellantis (the 3rd largest car manufacturer in the world) on the integration of electric vehicles to the power systems.

Previously I've worked in Chile as a consultant for industry and academia.
