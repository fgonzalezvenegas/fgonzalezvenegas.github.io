Hi!  I'm a researcher on energy transition, with a special interests in Smart Grids, electro-mobility and renewable energy resources.
I like to address issues both on the technical (optimization, modelling) and the economic and regulatory (electricity markets, policy implications) sides.

In the last three years I've been working on my PhD at Universit√© Paris-Saclay in collaboration with Stellantis (the 3rd largest car manufacturer in the world) on the integration of electric vehicles to the power systems.

Previously I've worked in Chile as a consultant for industry and academia.
